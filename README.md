# Clustering Algorithm for Cost/Distance of UK Train Routes #
-------------------------------------------------------------

Key Skills: Clustering | Machine Learning | Investigative Analysis | sklearn

Outcomes:
  - DBScan is optimal at detecting outlier routes of UK journeys
  - Plotting Cost/Distance against lat or lon highlights increased costs for routes travelling into UK cities
  - KMeans is not effective at clustering this data due to its sensitivity to outliers
